    * Created a landing page with a navbar at the top, linking to future pages. The main viewport features a large background image and several information cards relevant to the overall crusade. Added a background blur effect on the cards to improve readability over the background image. Applied transparency to the background image and used "isolation:isolate" on the h1 and card elements to prevent them from being affected by the transparency. While editing the image directly would have been a better approach, I found this solution online.
    * Future plans include creating additional pages for the site and implementing a wrapper for the navbar to avoid duplicating code on each new page.
