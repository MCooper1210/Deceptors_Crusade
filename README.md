    * Initial Commit
    * Created a landing page with a navbar at the top, linking to future pages. The main viewport features a large background image and several information cards relevant to the overall crusade. Added a background blur effect on the cards to improve readability over the background image. Applied transparency to the background image and used "isolation:isolate" on the h1 and card elements to prevent them from being affected by the transparency. While editing the image directly would have been a better approach, I found this solution online.
    * Future plans include creating additional pages for the site and implementing a wrapper for the navbar to avoid duplicating code on each new page.

     * Created one of the unit pages with the desired base layout. The information on this page relates to unit stat blocks from Warhammer 40,000, following a similar format. The aim is to update these stats as the Crusade games progress. I also plan to include pictures of my own models, although photography is not a strong-suit of mine.
     * Going forward, I aim to create a template for this layout, as I will be making nine pages in total that follow this format. Using a template will be more efficient than duplicating and manually editing each file.
     * My next goal is to create a wrapper for the Navbar at the top of the page.
